        "In this advanced deep learning assignment, students will select a neural network architecture to solve a task such as image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation. Students will have the freedom to choose from convolutional models, fully connected models, or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). They can fine-tune a pre-trained model, perform transfer learning, or train a model from scratch. This assignment will emphasize the use of **PyTorch Lightning** for training, **TensorBoard** or **Weights & Biases** for reporting, and **Optuna** for hyperparameter tuning. Students will evaluate their model’s performance on a test dataset and report key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
